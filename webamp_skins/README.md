# WebAmp Skins

Place `.wsz` Winamp skin files here. They will be automatically detected and offered as options in the **WebAmp Radio** node's skin dropdown.

## Finding Skins

Great sources for Winamp skins:
- [Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org/) — thousands of skins, download `.wsz` files
- [Archive.org Winamp skins collection](https://archive.org/search?query=winampskin&sort=-publicdate)

## How it works

Dropping a `.wsz` file in this directory makes it appear in the skin selector on the next ComfyUI refresh.
