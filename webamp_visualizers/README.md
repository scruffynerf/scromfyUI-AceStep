# WebAmp Milkdrop Presets

Place Butterchurn-compatible `.json` preset files here. They will be automatically detected and offered as options in the **WebAmp Radio ⚡** node's preset dropdown.

## Finding Presets

- [Butterchurn Presets Collection](https://github.com/jberg/butterchurn-presets)
- [Milkdrop Presets on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/milkdrop_presets) (Note: WebAmp/Butterchurn usually requires the JSON format conversion of these .milk files).

## How it works

Files in this directory appear in the `preset` dropdown on ComfyUI refresh.
